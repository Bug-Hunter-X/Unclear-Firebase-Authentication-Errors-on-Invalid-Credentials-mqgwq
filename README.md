# Firebase Authentication Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase Authentication: handling unclear error messages when signing in with invalid credentials. The `signInWithEmailAndPassword` method sometimes returns generic errors, making it difficult to determine the cause (incorrect email, incorrect password, or other issues). This example shows the problem and a possible solution.
